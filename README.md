# Realistic 3D Markers
A visually-driven project focused on mastering advanced CSS techniques to create realistic, three-dimensional markers using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates the power of CSS for graphic design and UI effects beyond typical webpage layouts.

## Project Overview
This project was an exploration into CSS's capabilities as a graphic design tool. The goal was to create realistic, shimmery 3D markers using only code—no images or external libraries. It highlights mastery of visual CSS properties that create depth, light, and texture.

- **Advanced Backgrounds**: linear-gradient

- **Shadows & Depth**: box-shadow

- **Color Models**: HSL and RGBA for precision and transparency

- **Modern Effects**: backdrop-filter for glassmorphism

- **Layout**: display and positioning properties


## Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
CSS3

## Key Features
Realistic 3D Effect: Crafted using layered linear gradients and precise shadows to simulate lighting and dimension.

Glassmorphism Container: Features a semi-transparent UI with blur effect for a modern aesthetic.

Accessibility Included: Implements screen-reader-only text to describe the visual content for users with disabilities.

Fully Responsive: Maintains its visual integrity across different screen sizes.

## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mikky-leo/css-3d-markers.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd css-3d-markers
```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:**
   -You can simply double-click the file, or
   -Use a local development server (e.g., with VS Code's Live Server extension).

## What I Learned & Demonstrated
-How to manipulate gradients and shadows to create the illusion of three-dimensional objects.
-The practical differences and use cases for HSL vs. RGB color models.
-The importance of providing alternative text for non-decorative graphics.
-Modern UI trends like glassmorphism and how to implement them with CSS.
